Capstone Project – Summer Analytics 2025
By: Nirnoy Barma

Urban parking spaces are often either overcrowded or underutilized due to static pricing. This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing engine for 14 parking lots using real-world data. We build three increasingly intelligent pricing models based on the following features:

Occupancy rate
Queue length
Vehicle type
Nearby traffic
Special events
Competitor prices

Tech Stack
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy – for data processing
Pathway – for real-time data simulation and ingestion
Bokeh or Matplotlib – for real-time visualization
Geopy – for distance calculations between parking lots
Google Colab – for development and execution
